  - Remaining Budget: The amount of budget left after expenses.
  - Spent Percentage: Show how much of the budget is used, e.g., "75% of your budget used."
  - Category Breakdown -
    A list of categories (like Food, Housing, Entertainment) with the following info:

    Consider using a bar chart or pie chart to show the percentage spent per category visually.

  - show monthly trends over time to compare spending patterns:
    A simple line chart or bar chart showing how much was spent each month.
    Highlight if there were significant increases/decreases compared to previous months.

## Things Included

The React project includes the following:

- Bootstrap 5 integration via CSS and JS scripts in the `index.html` file
- MUI# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

```
